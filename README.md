#vad_lsfm 

Golang implementation of voice activity detection (VAD) algorithm utilizing long-term spectral flatness measure (LSFM) which is capable of working at 10 dB and lower signal-to-noise ratios(SNRs).

This implementation based on paper:
"Efficient voice activity detection algorithm using long-term spectral flatness measure"
